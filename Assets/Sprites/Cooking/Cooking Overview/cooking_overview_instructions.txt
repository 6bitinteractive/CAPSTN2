cooking overview instructions
-------------------------
OPENING
-------------------------
1.) use the capiz window assets (except the anahaw)
3.) step_locked.png will appear along the middle of the screen one by one (according to how many
    steps there are for the dish)
         -for the "appearing" animation:
              1.) step_locked.png will "jump" (small upward animation), flip 
                  (similar to the boiling step animation before), and "fall" into place.
                   reference is similar to this: https://media.tenor.com/images/18e6bfd9f9b25a99c11761cef1815fed/tenor.gif
4.) once all assets have finished their animation, the first step would flip (again, similar fashion as the boiling steps before) 
    and be replaced with step_"stepname"_current.png 
5.) Once the player clicks on the step_"stepname"_current.png, the scene underneath the capiz window will change into that of
    the corresponding step segment (ex. the boiling segment)
6.) all elements of the cooking overview will fade out (except for the capiz windows)
7.) The capiz windows will "open", revealing the corresponding segment

--------------------------
CLOSING
--------------------------
1.) after the result screen, the capiz windows will once again "close"
2.) repeat steps stated above until all cooking segments gave been finished
3.) a "serve" button will appear on the bottom-right of the screen 
4.) once the button has been pressed, the capiz windows will "open" for the dish presentation 
    (instructions provided in the "completed dish" folder)
