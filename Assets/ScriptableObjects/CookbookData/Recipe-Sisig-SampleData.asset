    title: How to Cook
    description:
    - "This sisig recipe starts by boiling pork belly and pig ears until tender. These
      are then grilled for a few minutes until it browns and develops a good texture.
      I chop the meat into small pieces after grilling.\r\n\r\nStart cooking the sisig
      by sauteing ginger. Add chicken liver. Cook it thoroughly. Note that ginger\r\nis
      an optional ingredient for this sisig version. I added it to reduce the gaminess
      of chicken liver. Feel free to use it based on your preference."

    title: Origin
    description:
    - "Sisig originated from Pampanga. This place is considered as the culinary capital
      of the Philippines. It was invented by Lucia Cunanan. She is popularly known
      as Aling Lucing and the Sisig queen.\r\n\r\nThe US military bases located in
      the town might have played a role in the invention of this dish. People can
      buy cheap pig heads in commissaries because these are not normally consumed
      inside the base. Meat from the pig heads are scraped out, boiled, grilled, and
      made into what is now known as Sisig."
